            Hi! I&apos;m Narae, a Designer & Developer with a passion for
            blending aesthetic design and technological innovation to craft

          <p className="mb-5">
            With over three years of experience in marketing and UX/UI design,
            I've further honed my skills in web development through dedicated
            self-study over the past year and a half.

          <p className="mb-5">
            My approach is rooted in effective communication and collaboration.
            Understanding user needs is key, and I've learned the importance of
            working closely with clients, users, stakeholders, and colleagues to
            achieve our goals.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5">
            I'm proficient in Figma, Adobe Creative Suite and front-end
            technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, SASS, TailwindCSS,
            Style-Components and more. I thrive on creating user-centered
            solutions and collaborating with diverse teams.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe in the power of design and technology to transform
            businesses and improve lives and I&apos;m ready to get my heart
            pumping and work alongside like-minded professionals to grow
            together.
