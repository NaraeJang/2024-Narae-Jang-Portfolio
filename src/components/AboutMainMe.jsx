            Hi! Iâ€™m narae who is passionate about coding and view it as a
            powerful tool to bring imaginative concepts to life in the online
            world. With over three years of experience in the design realm, I've
            gained a profound understanding of the intricacies of creating
            visually appealing and functional digital experiences.

            design background and web development skills equips me to bridge the
            gap between aesthetics and functionality seamlessly.
