            Bar Ganadara is a Korean fusion bar located in the heart of downtown
            Montreal. The bar sought to express a Korean retro style through
            their menu design.
          </p>
          <p>
            To capture the desired retro vibes, I began by creating a mood board
            that drew inspiration from retro elements such as typography,
            colors, and imagery. This visual compilation guided the design
            process, ensuring alignment with the client's vision while
            facilitating collaborative discussions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Understanding the clientâ€™s needs, I ensured consistent communication
            with them, refining the designs based on their feedback.
            Additionally, I handled print preparation, collaborated with
            vendors, and conducted quality checks to ensure the final product
            met the desired standards.
