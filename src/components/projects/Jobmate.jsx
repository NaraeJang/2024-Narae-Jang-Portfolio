              One of my online courses featured a similar project, and I thought
              it would be great to create my own based on that existing one.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, I aimed to incorporate different features, functions,
              layouts, and designs. Therefore, I began by jotting down
              everything I wanted to implement in this app, contemplating ways
              to enhance the user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the design side, I progressed from low-fidelity wireframes to
              high-fidelity wireframes, developed a design system, and created a
              simple prototype.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of development, following the design, I initiated the
              front-end setup, including establishing basic CSS, structuring
              pages using React Router DOM with mock data, and developing CSS
              for each page using the Styled Components library. Afterward, I
              delved into the back-end, setting up the server, connecting to
              MongoDB using Mongoose, and creating schemas, routes, controllers,
              and custom errors. Once both front-end and back-end were in place,
              I integrated them using Axios and transferred data to the MongoDB
              Database. I tested CRUD methods from the front-end, addressing any
              bugs that arose.
            </p>

            <p>
              To enhance the user experience, I utilized React Query for
              managing and caching data, optimizing loading times and
              eliminating the need to submit data each time a page is loaded.
            </p>

            <p>
              The most challenging aspect was seamlessly connecting data without
              errors. Especially on the "All Jobs" pages, various methods were
              employed to communicate with the serverâ€”retrieving all data,
              updating data, deleting data, and fetching data specific to the
              user's search. Managing data and making functions independent yet
              seamlessly interconnected were significant learning points during
              this project. Being my first MERN Project, it took me a month to
              complete, presenting a fulfilling challenge and a valuable
              learning experience.
