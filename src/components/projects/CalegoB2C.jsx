            Calego owns four travel accessories brands (iFLY, VACAY, IFLY SMART,
            Sammys), each with its own website. This fragmented structure made
            it challenging for users to find products and complete purchases
            across different brands. Additionally, SEO and reviews were
            dispersed, leading to a disjointed customer experience and impacting
            sales.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address these issues, we undertook the initiative to consolidate
            all separate websites into a unified platform. This strategic
            decision aimed to streamline user interactions and enhance Calegoâ€™s
            sales potential. As the sole UX/UI Designer on this project, I led
            the effort from inception to delivery.
