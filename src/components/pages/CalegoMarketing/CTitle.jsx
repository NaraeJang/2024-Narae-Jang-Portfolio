        As the sole Senior Graphic Designer in the marketing department, I was
        responsible for email campaigns, web content creating & updating, social
        media content creating, presentation templates, website redesigning,
        creating new collection landing pages and refining brand & influencer
        guidelines. I also helped with the planning & executing & photo shoots
        and retouching selected photos. When Calego cooperated with other
        companies, I communicated with their marketing or sales team and
        designed the assets they needed as the lead designer.
