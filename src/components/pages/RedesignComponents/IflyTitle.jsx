          <p className="mt-[1.75rem]">
            Calego is a company that owns 4 travel accessories brands&lpar;IFLY,
            VACAY, IFLY SMART, Sammys&rpar; with each its website. Because of
            that, The users had a hard time finding the product they want. If
            they wanted to purchase 2 different products from different brands
            at once, the consumer had to sign in to different websites and order
            separately. Furthermore, all the SEO and reviews were spread out and
            disorganized. This inevitably affected their sale.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-[1.75rem]">
            Therefore, we decided to combine all separated websites into one
            website so that the users can easily interact with the web to reach
            their goals and Calego can drive more sales in the future. As the
            sole UX/UI Designer, I was tasked with this project from conception
            to delivery. While working on the project, I collaborated with the
            CMO, Art Director, Digital Creative Director, Marketing Coordinator
            and developer teams.
